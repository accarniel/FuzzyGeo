# Spatial Plateau Algebra

In this GitHub repository, you are able to find the implementation of the Spatial Plateau Algebra (SPA). SPA is a conceptual implementation for fuzzy spatial data by providing the *plateau spatial data types*. Here, SPA is implemented as a new abstract data type in the PostgreSQL, called PlateauGeometry. We are working on making this implementation and its documentation publicly available.

In addition, we provide algorithms related to SPA. The first one refers to provide a systematic and generic approach to deal with the general issue of collecting and constructing fuzzy region objects as plateau region objects from real data sets and leveraging domain expert knowledge. Currently, we are working on making this implementation, its documentation, and application examples publicly available.
